I do not own any of the images used as pieces, and I have used the sprite sheet from
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Chess_Pieces_Sprite.svg/2000px-Chess_Pieces_Sprite.svg.png.

This is just original version, to play the game run the EpicGameChallenge.py.
Unforunately, I didn't have enough time to work in if the king is in check, or if it is checkmate, so to win
the opposite player has to take over the enemy king and win according to that.
